# Cyclistic-Case-Study
Capstone project as part of the Google Data Analyst Professional Certificate course on the Coursera learning platform.
<br>
### Scenario
As a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
our team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
our team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve your recommendations.
